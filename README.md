Studio is a community-based hazard reporting system built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Supabase, and Twilio.  It empowers users to report hazards in their community, fostering a safer and more informed environment.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/studio.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd studio
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Setup environment variables (refer to `.env.example` for details).
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


## Usage

Users can easily report hazards through a user-friendly interface.  The system allows users to:

* Submit hazard reports with descriptions, locations (using geolocation), and photos.
* View reported hazards on a map.
* Filter hazards by type and severity.
* Receive notifications about nearby hazards.  (Twilio integration for SMS alerts - feature to be implemented)

**(Example of a simplified report submission form -  replace with actual component code)**

```jsx
// Example component -  Illustrative purposes only

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Hazard Description" />
  <input type="text" placeholder="Location" />
  <input type="file" accept="image/*" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
